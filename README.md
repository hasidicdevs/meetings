# Hasidic Development Group

Each meeting has its own agenda which is published before the meeting. Minutes will be posted in the agenda document after the meeting concludes, including topics discussed, decisions made, and future items for discussion. The outline for new meetings is in [FORMAT](FORMAT.md) the process for scheduling meetings and follow up is in [PROCESS](PROCESS.md)

## Information on open Community meetings

We plan to follow a similar format to that of the WebAssembly Community Group, which is itself based on standards meetings. If you aren't familiar with how such meetings work, [this paper on standards committee participation for newbies](http://wirfs-brock.com/allen/files/papers/standpats-asianplop2016.pdf) is worth a look!

We differ from the standards process in that the HDG Board reserves final say on decisions pertaining to its products, but our hope is that by involving the community from start to finish, we can find broad consensus on decisions that are made.

There is also discussion happening in [HDG's Community on GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/hasidicdevs/discussions)
