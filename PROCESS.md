# Process

## Attendance

Meetings will be announced in advance via PR on this repository. The announcement will include
meeting details, such as the Zoom meeting URL, date/time, etc. It will also include the agenda
for the meeting, which can be extended by opening a PR with the topic you wish to have put on
the agenda.

**Meetings recur on the first Sunday of every month at 1pm Eastern Time.**

## Meetings

Meetings will follow this rough outline:

- Introduce attendees
- Quick status update from HDG
- Review the agenda, determine if changes are required, and agree on them if any are proposed
- Walk through the agenda, item by item
- Determine any action items and/or future agenda topics
- Wrap up

## Agenda

Agenda items can be added by anyone, by opening a PR against the meeting announcement and adding your item to the list. If an agenda item is a proposed feature, or other significant change, the champion of that proposal should include any reference material needed for other attendees to prepare. It is not acceptable to propose an agenda item that requires preparation less than 7 days prior to the next meeting; such proposals should go under the list of future agenda items.
